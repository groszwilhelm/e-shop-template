# Online shop

### Implement the designs from the resources folder with the following considerations:

- Designs to be implemented: desktop.png, desktop-menu.png, list-1920.png, product-1920.png.
- The other screen resolutions are optional but a great addition if you have time for them.
- In case you are implementing all layouts use mobile first approach.
- When listing the products use json-server to store the product information in db.json similar to what we did at the courses and use fetch to retrieve them and show in the UI (store also the url to the product image together with the rest of the details).
- When clicking on a product it should navigate to the product page where we can see the exact same product that has been clicked on.
- In order to navigate to the list page you should be able to click on the MEN's WEAR / WOMEN'S WEAR navigation button.
- Additional functionality that you see in the UI doesn't need to be implemented, like filtering, shopping cart, product search, add to cart.


>As bonus implement the additional designs on different screen resolutions.
Add a shopping cart and implement the functionality to add and remove products from the shopping cart.
Shopping cart should be stored in db.json and be visible also after refreshing the page.
